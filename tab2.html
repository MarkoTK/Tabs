   Cristiano Ronaldo was born on February 5, 1985, in Funchal, Madeira in Portugal.
Ronaldo joined Clube Desportivo Nacional of Madeira and then transferred to Sporting Clube de Portugal (known as Sporting Lisbon), where he played for that club’s various youth football (soccer) teams before making his debut on Sporting’s first team in 2002. He signed with English powerhouse Manchester United in 2003. This was where Ronaldo’s career got a turn for the better, when he started playing for Manchester United at a young age. While playing for Manchester United he got famous and became one of the best football stars/players. 


An instant sensation, Ronaldo came to be regarded as one of football’s best forwards. His finest season with United came in 2007–08, when he scored 42 League and Cup goals and earned the Golden Shoe award as Europe’s leading scorer, with 31 League goals. He is the all-time leading scorer for Spain’s Real Madrid. 

He also led United to an appearance in the 2009 Champions League final, which they lost to FC Barcelona.



Ronaldo helped United to a Champions League title in May 2008 and captured Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) World Player of the Year honors for his stellar 2007–08 season. He was captain of Portugal’s national team in the 2014 and 2018 World Cup competitions and was the third person to earn a lifetime contract from the sportswear company Nike.
Ronaldo is one of the few lifelong athletes who have lifelong contracts at Nike. 
Ronaldo signed with Real Madrid a club with which he had long been rumored to want to play—for a then record £80 million (about $131 million)He continued to score with his new team, and he made themost goals (40) in La Liga history during the 2010–11 season (his record was broken the following season by his rival Lionel Messi of Barcelona). In 2011–12 Ronaldo helped Madrid capture a La Liga championship and scored a personal-best 46 goals during the League season. He scored a total of 66 goals in 56 appearances with Madrid and the Portuguese national team in 2013 to earn his second world player of the year award (the FIFA World Player of the Year was renamed the FIFA Ballon d’Or in 2010). In 2014 he scored 52 goals in 43 games and led Madrid to a Champions n. In 2016 he helped Portugal win the European Championship, the country’s first major international tournament title, League title, which resulted in Ronaldo capturing another Ballon d’Or award.
